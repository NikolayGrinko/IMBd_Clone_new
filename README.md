# IMBd_Clone_new
Launched online in 1990 and a subsidiary of Amazon.com since 1998, IMDb is the world's most popular and authoritative content for movies, television and celebrities, designed to help authorities police the world of movies and shows and decide what to watch.

In this application, I developed a CollectionView view with sections by category.
There is also the option to go to the page search and download the desired content, then go to the page content describing the characteristics of the content (title, review, release date).
And watch directly on YouTube.
But there are problems:
- The free subscription was canceled and from August 1 the code is no longer valid and you will not be able to download content.
But the idea may suit someone.
Good luck to all.
